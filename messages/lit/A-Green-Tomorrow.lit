A Green Tomorrow

Starting a few decades ago, there was a massive global movement towards the generation of renewable energy in an effort to combat global warming and climate change. The shift towards renewable energy was a big success, or so it seemed. In 2045 a staggering 80% of the world's energy came from non-renewable fossil fuels. Now, about three decades later, that number is down to only 15%. Most of the world's energy now comes from nuclear power and renwable sources such as solar and geothermal. Unfortunately, these efforts were not the huge success that they seem to be.

Since 2045 primary energy use has soared almost tenfold. This was mainly due to growing urban populations and the rise of increasingly advanced (and power-hungry) technology that has become ubiquitous in our lives. So, despite the fact that the percentage of our energy that comes from fossil fuels has drastically decreased, the total amount of energy we are producing from fossil fuels has actually increased.

The grim effects of our species' irresponsible use of energy and neglect of our mother world have become increasingly apparent. Last year a temperature of 190F was recorded in the Death Valley desert, which is over 50% higher than the highest recorded temperature at the beginning of the century. In the last two decades numerous major cities such as Manhattan, Boston, and Los Angeles have been partially or fully submerged by rising sea levels. In the present day, over 75% of the world's agriculture is done in climate-controlled vertical farms, as most traditional farmland has become unusable due to severe climate conditions.
