# Bitburner Scripts

This repository contains my files and scripts for the browser game [Bitburner](https://github.com/danielyxie/bitburner).

I'm faily new to the game, but my plan is to create a fully automated botnet and suite of tools for visualizing and managing the network. I'd like the botnet to cover:

- Downloading and bootstrapping the entire system with one script
- Owning, growing, hacking and weakening hosts
- Completing contracts
- Playing the stock market
- Managing hacknet nodes for early game cash
- And I'm sure I'll want to add more as I learn more about the game

This repo is a work in progress.
