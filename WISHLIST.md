# My Wishlist for Bitburner

- "Dynamic RAM calculation" bug gets fixed
- Terminal doesn't scroll you to the bottom when new lines come in
- Ability to connect to any host from any other host. Why can I scp from home to any host, but not connect from home to any host?
- Folders on each host
- Better UI, for example:
  - Visual display of the network with interactive nodes for connecting, etc
